## Indexing Phase
Indexing phase is used to create the index for the given text. This index is used to query

### Source documents

### Text Chunking 
This is the chunking strategy which is used to chunk the documents. This is completly dependent upon the how is our document organized and what is the best approach to do so.

### Entity Extraction

### Relationship Extraction

### Knowledge Graph Generation

### Community Detection

### Heirarchial Community Structure 

### Community Levels
* Root Level C0
* High Level C1 
* Low Level C3 

### Generate Community Services
